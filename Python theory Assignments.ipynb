    "# Python Programming: Questions and Answers\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. What is Python, and why is it popular?\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simple, readable syntax and versatility. Created by Guido van Rossum and released in 1991, Python is popular because:\n",
    "- It is easy to learn and use.\n",
    "- It is open source and cross-platform.\n",
    "- It has an extensive standard library.\n",
    "- It is widely used in web development, data science, automation, artificial intelligence, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. What is an interpreter in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "A Python interpreter is a program that executes Python code line-by-line. It converts high-level Python code into bytecode, which is then executed by the Python Virtual Machine (PVM). This enables interactive coding and easier debugging, making Python an interpreted language.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Pre-defined keywords in Python are reserved words that have special meaning in the language’s syntax. These cannot be used as variable names, function names, or identifiers. Examples include: `if`, `else`, `for`, `while`, `def`, `return`, `import`, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Can keywords be used as variable names?\n",
    "\n",
    "No,keywords cannot be used as variable names in Python because they are reserved for specific language functions. Attempting to do so will result in a syntax error.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. What is mutability in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Mutability refers to whether an object’s value can be changed after it is created:\n",
    "- Mutable objects (like lists, dictionaries) can be changed in place.\n",
    "- Immutable objects (like tuples, strings) cannot be altered once created.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Lists are mutable: Their contents can be changed, added, or removed after creation.\n",
    "- Tuples are immutable: Their contents cannot be changed once defined. This immutability makes tuples useful for fixed data and ensures data integrity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "- `==` operator checks if the values of two variables are equal.\n",
    "- `is` operator checks if two variables refer to the same object in memory.  \n",
    "  `'=='` compares value equality, while `'is'` compares identity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. What are logical operators in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Logical operators are used to combine conditional statements. The main logical operators are:\n",
    "- `and`: True if both operands are true.\n",
    "- `or`: True if at least one operand is true.\n",
    "- `not`: Reverses the truth value.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9. What is type casting in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Type casting is the process of converting a variable from one data type to another, such as converting an integer to a string or a float to an integer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 10. What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Implicit type casting: Python automatically converts one data type to another without programmer intervention.\n",
    "- Explicit type casting: The programmer manually converts data types using functions like `int()`, `str()`, or `float()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 11. What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Conditional statements are used to execute different blocks of code based on certain conditions. They help in decision-making processes within a program.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 12. How does the `elif` statement work?\n",
    "\n",
    "The `elif` (else if) statement allows checking multiple conditions sequentially. If the first condition is false, the program checks the next `elif` condition, and so on, until one condition is true or the `else` block is executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 13. What is the difference between for and while loops?\n",
    "\n",
    "- For loop: Used to iterate over a sequence (like a list, tuple, or range) a fixed number of times.\n",
    "- While loop: Runs as long as a specified condition is true, making it suitable for indefinite iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 14. Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "A while loop is more suitable when the number of iterations is not known beforehand and depends on a condition being met.  \n",
    "Example: Reading data from a sensor until a certain threshold is reached, or waiting for user input to exit a program."
